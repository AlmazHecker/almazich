The performance of lightweight pages can sometimes lag, while heavier applications run smoothly. This discrepancy lies in browser rendering threads and the pixel pipeline.

## Core Threads in Browser Rendering

Browsers typically utilize three primary threads:

1. **UI Thread**
   Handles browser interface elements (tabs, address bar), separate from page rendering.

2. **Renderer Thread (Main Thread)**
   Executes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It handles:

   - DOM/CSSOM parsing
   - Style calculation
   - Layout (reflow)
   - Painting

3. **Compositor Thread**
   Uses the GPU to render the final output to the screen. It operates independently from the main thread, optimized for:

   - Transform operations (scale, skew, rotate)
   - Opacity changes
   - Smooth scrolling

## The Pixel Pipeline: 5 Key Phases

{{< figure align=center src="./pixel-pipeline.jpg" caption="Pixel pipeline phases" >}}

1. **JavaScript/CSS**
   Triggers visual updates such as DOM changes or class toggles.

2. **Style**
   Applies CSS rules to DOM nodes.

   _Tip:_ Use simple selectors to minimize rendering cost (avoid deep descendant selectors like `div > ul > li a`).

3. **Layout (Reflow)**
   Calculates element geometry (position and size).

   - Expensive if affecting many elements.

4. **Paint & Rasterization**

   - _Paint (CPU)_: Generates drawing instructions for the GPU.
   - _Rasterization (GPU)_: Converts drawing instructions into pixel data.

   At this stage, DOM nodes become GPU-backed textures but aren't yet composed into the final image.

5. **Composite**
   Combines these textures into the final screen output, handling z-index, overlaps, transforms, etc.
   Operates on the Compositor Thread.

## Optimizing the Pixel Pipeline

Browsers optimize the pipeline to avoid executing all five phases unnecessarily:

1. **Full Pipeline** (JS → Style → Layout → Paint → Composite)
   Triggered by geometry changes (e.g., width, height, position). A layout change requires a full reflow and repaint.

2. **Skip Layout** (JS → Style → Paint → Composite)
   Triggered by visual-only changes (e.g., color, background). These don't affect layout and skip the layout phase.

3. **Skip Layout and Paint** (JS → Style → Composite)
   Triggered by transform/opacity changes. These are handled in the Compositor Thread, skipping Layout and Paint phases entirely.

## Reflow (Layout) Optimization

When a DOM node's geometry changes, the browser reflows only the affected nodes. However, layout changes can cascade, affecting parent or sibling nodes and triggering additional reflows.

> To optimize reflows, avoid changes that affect ancestor or sibling layout. Ensure fixed container sizes to avoid pushing children outside their bounds.

Accessing layout properties (e.g., width, height, offsetTop) triggers reflow because layout properties are calculated on-demand for performance.

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById("submit-btn");
console.log(button.style.width); // reflow triggered
console.log(button.getBoundingClientRect()); // reflow triggered
```

## GPU Compositing Layers

Compositing layers are **isolated render surfaces** promoted during the Layout phase. These layers:

1. Layout and Paint once (initial render).
2. Are cached in GPU memory.
3. Skip layout and paint on subsequent updates.

Elements using GPU-optimized properties such as `transform`, `opacity`, and certain filters are promoted to compositing layers.

These properties don’t modify HTML structure but only visual appearance, allowing for faster updates. When modified, compositing layers are redrawn directly from the GPU memory without needing recalculations.

> Modifying properties like `width`, `height`, or `background` forces a full pipeline since they impact layout.

Use compositing layers wisely. Excessive use can increase GPU memory consumption, slowing performance on mobile devices.

```css
/* Good - Animate what's necessary */
.slide-in {
  transform: translateX(0);
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}

/* Bad - Forces unnecessary layer creation */
.static-element {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Animations:**
   Prefer `transform` over `left`/`top` for animations. Transform is GPU-accelerated and runs on the Compositor Thread, avoiding layout and paint phases, preserving Main Thread performance.

   ```css
   /* Bad - Triggers layout and paint on each frame */
   @keyframes janky {
     from {
       left: 0;
     }
     to {
       left: 100px;
     }
   }

   /* Good - Composite-only, GPU-accelerated */
   @keyframes smooth {
     from {
       transform: translateX(0);
     }
     to {
       transform: translateX(100px);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **DOM Interaction:**
   Batch DOM reads and writes to avoid **layout thrashing**. Forced synchronous layout, where JavaScript reads and writes to the DOM in an alternate manner, causes repeated reflows and performance degradation.

   ```javascript
   // Bad: alternate reads/writes → multiple forced reflows
   elements.forEach((el) => {
     el.style.width = `${el.offsetWidth}px`;
     // offsetWidth forces layout
     // style.width triggers layout recalculation (reflow) because geometry changes
   });

   // Good: Batched reads and writes → single reflow
   const widths = elements.map((el) => el.offsetWidth);
   elements.forEach((el, i) => {
     el.style.width = `${widths[i]}px`;
   });
   ```

3. **`requestAnimationFrame` Sync Updates with the Browser’s Render Cycle.**
   Use rAF to sync visual updates with the browser’s refresh rate (typically 60fps). Avoids jank and reduces wasted frames.

   ```javascript
   // Animating box position in sync with the browser’s refresh rate

   let position = 0;
   function animate(timestamp) {
     position += 1;
     box.style.transform = `translateX(${position}px)`;

     if (position < 300) {
       requestAnimationFrame(animate);
     }
   }
   requestAnimationFrame(animate); // Start the animation
   ```

## Debugging Tools

1. **Chrome DevTools:**

- **Layer Tab**: Visualize compositing layers.
- **Performance Tab**: Record animation frames.
- **Rendering Tab**: Inspect paints and layer behaviors.

## Key Takeaways

1. Offload rendering work to the Compositor Thread (via transform/opacity).
2. Minimize layout thrashing by batching DOM operations.
3. Use GPU layers strategically—optimize for performance and memory.
4. Test on low-end devices to understand memory and performance constraints.

## Fun Facts

Chrome optimizes scrolling to always occur on the Compositor Thread. Even with the main thread blocked (e.g., running a `while(true)` loop), scrolling remains responsive, demonstrating the power of GPU acceleration for certain tasks.
